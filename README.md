# SHAREFLIX
ShareFlix is an app that enables the user to curate "watch lists" that are made for them, with the help of people who know them. 

Streaming services are great but the algorithms that recommend what to watch are not. They often get it wrong or are influenced by the politics and finances of the movie and tv industry. And that means that users will spend an average of 18 minutes trying to decide what to watch next.

Users of ShareFilx will no longer have to waste time searching. As soon as a friend tells recommends a "watchable" they can pop it into the app with the touch of one button, adding in the most important info - the name, who recommended it, and where to find it. When it comes time to watch something, a quick glance at their list will guide them to their next show.

Other features include the ability to make recommendations (which show up on the public profile), find and follow friends, and create a custom profile page.

## Next Steps
The original app was created by three developers - [ZoÃ«](https://github.com/zsiskos), [Ardy](https://github.com/ArdyParty), and [Brandon](https://github.com/bernallium) - in one week. The MVPs were acheived for this deadline but additional features will be added in future iterations. They include:

- Further styling
- Friend page to show images of friends and a list of their most recent recommendations
- Search functionality to find
- Abilty to unfollow someone
- Connect to an api that will pull in additional information (i.e. images)
- Dropdown menu with streaming choices in 'How Heard' option
- Mobile app
